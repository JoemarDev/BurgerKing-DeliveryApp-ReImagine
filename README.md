# Burger King Re-Imagine

This project is created in order to fully understand the concept of React Context.
And to leverage the other functionality of Firebase such as FireStore as well the Firebase Authentication.
In this project, I learn to fully use data(props) in every component without using the prop-drilling method, by using Context.
I also learn how to use the React Router, such us useNavigate Routes, Outlet ect.
I also learn to use sass in react as well the styled-component. and learn how to write react in more efficient way.

### App Feature
1. Search Product
2. Add To Cart
3. Firebase Authentication using (Google Login)
4. Categories Product.
5. CRUD in All Context in the product.
